# Welcome to Harmoniza 🌿

**Experience calm like never before.**  
Harmoniza introduces a world of introspective **lofi** and **ambient music**, ideal for relaxation, focus, and creative inspiration.

As a **solo artist** based in Cape Town, South Africa, I’m excited to share the journey of Harmoniza with you. Whether you’re here to unwind, spark your creativity, or explore fresh sounds for your projects, Harmoniza is your home for music that resonates with the soul.
